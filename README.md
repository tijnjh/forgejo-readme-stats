# Forgejo Readme Statistics

## Example

[![Tijn's GitHub stats](https://frs.jonas.zone/langs/tijn)](https://codeberg.org/tijn/forgejo-readme-stats)

## Usage

To add this feature to your profile, insert the following code into your `.profile/README.md`:

(replace `tijn` with your username of course)

```
![Tijn's GitHub stats](https://frs.jonas.zone/langs/tijn)]
```

This implementation supports custom instances by appending the parameter `?instance=<your_instance_url>` to the URL.

**Note:** Custom instances are supported only if they provide a public API that does not require authentication via bearer token.
